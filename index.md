## Voice-over

Before you begin: I recommend reading “A Defense and History of Voice-Over Narration” (Kozloff), “The Problem of Speaking for Others” (Martìn Alcoff), “The Three Listening Modes” (Chion), and “The Grain of the Voice” (Barthes).

You should also review the following texts, which we've discussed (if only briefly) during class meetings: “Hello!” (Sterne); “The Beauty of Noise: An Interview with Masami Akita of Merzbow”; “Noise and Politics” (Attali); “The Future of Music: Credo” (Cage); “The Art of Noises” (Russolo); selections from *Pink Noises* by Rodgers; “Replicant: On Dub” (Toop); “The Invisible Generation” (Burroughs); “Operating System for the Redesign of Sonic Reality” (Eshun); “Bettered by the Borrower: The Ethics of Musical Debt” (Oswald); “Composition as Process” (Cage); the *Sounding Out!* Series on Alan Lomax; “Into Sound” (Bull and Back); “Modes of Listening” (Cox and Warner); “Some Sound Observations” (Oliveros); “The Music of the Environment” (Schafer); “Ambient Music” (Eno); “The Politics of Hearing” (Eisler and Adorno); “Acousmatics” (Schaeffer); and “The Liberation of Sound” (Varèse).

## Aims of this Assignment 

For you to:

* Directly engage the relationships between audio, narrative, and questions of representation (audio, but for whom, by whom, how, to what effects, and under what assumptions).
* Through your own audio composition, experiment with concepts (e.g., audiovisual litany, acousmatic sound, silence, noise, audiovisual dissonance, and semantic listening) we’ve discussed during class meetings.
* Develop an audio piece that critically corresponds with visuals and visual culture.
Interrogate the role of voice in sound, film, and cultural studies through a combination of knowing and doing.
Gain additional experience in critical/deep listening, sound recording, and editing audio.

## Contraints

* Between one and two minutes of audio
* Audio should correspond with one to two minutes of a specific television show or film
* However many tracks or recordings you deem necessary
* A title for the piece (also the title for your blog entry)
* At least one voice-over track, however long you deem appropriate (voice does not need to be yours)
* Effects and generated sounds are encouraged
* Voices can be altered/edited
* A precise, polished rationale for your piece (~250 words)
* A script for your voice-over track(s)   

## Steps (take them or leave them)

* Select a clip from a television show or film that you think (for whatever reason) is interesting from the perspective of sound studies. This clip should involve voice-over, or it should have potential for voice-over (however you define that potential).
* Watch and listen to it “as is” (i.e., as it’s intended to be seen and heard). Note how (if applicable) voices are functioning in the clip and to what effects on how characters are represented. Who speaks for whom and how? Examine the clip with audiovisual dissonance and punctuation in mind.
* Listen to it without watching the visuals. Either turn off the screen or look away from it. Take notes on soundmarks, sound signals, and keynote sounds. Also attend to sonic flow, synch points, and sound shots. What is the auditory setting, and how does it influence narrative?
* Watch it with the sounds muted. Take notes on the effect of silence. If voice-over is used, then observe the effects of its absence. Also determine what, if any, visuals are more noticeable when the audio is muted. What is still meaningful without audio? What requires audio?
* After extended study of the clip, determine something specific that is key to its use or non-use of sound. This should be something that, if altered, would dramatically alter the interpretation of the clip. The more specific that something is, the easier this assignment will be.
* Now begin drafting a new audio layer for your one- to two-minute clip. This audio layer will replace the existing one. (See more below.) How you draft the audio is up to you. You can use paper and/or an audio editor. You can use found sound or recorded sound. You can use effects and generated sounds as you choose.
* During the drafting process, include—at some point—a voice-over track, which does NOT need to play throughout your audio layer. Type the spoken content of the track into a word processor or text editor and then save it. This text will be the voice-over script you will submit for your piece. If you wish, then in the script you can also include references to effects.
* Using your draft material, record and edit your audio layer. Then export it as an MP3.
* Test it (at least twice) with your clip, playing the clip with: a) the intended sounds muted, and b) your MP3 playing over it. If you like, then you can use a video editor here. If you don’t know how to edit video, then you can simply use an MP3 playback device while your video is playing. In this case, do your best to sync your audio with the existing visual track. (Again, this course is not about hi-fi production.)
* If possible, have someone watch the clip with and without your soundtrack. Get feedback. Take notes how the audience responds to your soundtrack.
* Where necessary, revise your audio layer.
* Save your project, export it (again) as an MP3, and upload the MP3 to the class audio blog. Contact me if you encounter any hiccups or snags.
* In the same post as your audio file, please provide a ~250-word rationale for your audio layer, including the voice-over. In the rationale, please reference discussions from class, texts we’ve read, clips we’ve watched, and/or audio we’ve heard. In short, connect your audio piece with the course material (in particular) and with sound studies (in general). At some point in the rationale, you should specifically address: a) how and why you composed the voice-over track, and b) that “something specific” about your clip that you deemed key to its use of sound (see step 5 above).
* In the post, below your rationale, you should also include the script for your voice-over. Again, your voice-over track does NOT need to play throughout your audio layer. But there should be some voice-over at some point in the piece.
* Also, your entry should also tell me how your peers and I can locate and watch your clip. (See me for details.)

## Outcomes  

* Your audio layer is a critical engagement with film or television. It should be aware of how it is intervening in your selected clip’s interpretation, and the ways it is intervening should be clear to most audiences.
* Your rationale should articulate how your audio layer builds, extends, and even complicates at least one sound studies concept we’ve discussed during class. It should also demonstrate your familiarity with the course material.
* Your voice-over track is an act of representation and persuasion. It should be aware of how and for whom it is speaking, under what assumptions, and to what possible effects.
* Your audio layer should be composed with an intended effect on its intended audience: laughter, dissonance, detachment, self-reflection, or the like. The effect should be tied to the argument you are making (explicitly or tacitly) through your audio composition.
* Your voice-over should be your most persuasive work yet this semester.

## Schedule 

This audio piece (including the MP3, the written rationale, and the script) is due on our audio blog by the start of class on Thursday, December 3rd. The audio blog entry should include a title and your playable MP3, together with the rationale (~250 words) and script. Please categorize it under “voice-over.” Thank you!
